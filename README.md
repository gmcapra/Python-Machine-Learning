# Python-Machine-Learning
Repository for practice projects related to implementation of various Machine Learning Algorithms with Python in an effort to analyze/visualize data and predict target variables. Necessary data files will either be included in each respective folder, or loaded through the respective .py script. Scripts can be run directly from the command line or terminal but will require the necessary libraries to be installed.

Within this repository are Python scripts demonstrating implementation of the following Machine Learning Algorithms:
- Implement Linear Regression Models
- Implement Logistic Regression Models
- Use the K Nearest Neighbor Classification Algorithm
- Use Decision Trees and Random Forests
- Use the K Means Clustering Algorithm
- Use Support Vector Machines and GridSearch
- Perform Principal Component Analysis (factor analysis) 
- Build Recommendation Systems based on a dataset

The main libraries that will be used include: 
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- SciKit Learn
