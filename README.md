# Python-Machine-Learning
Repository to house simple or advanced practice projects related to implementation of various Machine Learning Algorithms with Python in an effort to analyze and visualize data, and predict target variables. Necessary data files will either be included in each respective folder, or loaded through the respective .py script. Scripts can be run directly from the command line or terminal but will require the necessary libraries to be installed.

Within this repository are Python practice scripts and projects related to using Data Analysis and Machine Learning to:
- Implement Linear Regression Models
- Implement Logistic Regression Models
- Use the K Nearest Neighbor Classification Algorithm to predict target values from data sets
- Use Decision Trees and Random Forests to predict target value from feature variables
- Use the K Means Clustering Algorithm to attempt to label unlabeled data by grouping similar clusters
- Use Support Vector Machines and GridSearch to predict target class based on data features
- Perform Principal Component Analysis (factor analysis) to identify features causing most variance in a dataset
- Build Recommendation Systems based on a dataset

The main libraries that will be used include: 
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- SciKit Learn
* Additional libraries may be needed for certain scripts
