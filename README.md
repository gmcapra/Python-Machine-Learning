# Python-Machine-Learning
Repository for practice projects related to implementation of various Machine Learning Algorithms with Python in an effort to analyze/visualize data and predict target variables. Necessary data files will either be included in each respective folder, or loaded in the .py script when it is run. Scripts can be run directly from the command line or terminal but will require the necessary libraries to be installed.

Within this repository are Python scripts demonstrating implementation of the following Machine Learning Algorithms:

- Linear Regression Models
- Logistic Regression Models
- K Nearest Neighbor Classification 
- Decision Trees and Random Forests
- K Means Clustering
- Support Vector Machines and GridSearch Parameter Optimization
- Principal Component Analysis (Factor Analysis) 
- Intro to Recommendation Systems

The main libraries that are used in these scripts: 
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- SciKit Learn
- TensorFlow
