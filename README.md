# Python-Machine-Learning
Repository to house simple or advanced practice projects related to implementation of various Machine Learning Algorithms with Python in an effort to analyze and visualize data, and predict target variables.

Within each subfolder there are practice scripts related to each topic and its implementation in Python. Necessary data files will either be included in each respective folder, or loaded through the .py script.

Scripts can be run directly from the command line or terminal but will require the necessary libraries to be installed.

The main libraries that will be needed include: Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and SciKit Learn. Additional libraries may be needed for specific scripts. This will be indicated within the readme of each subfolder topic.
